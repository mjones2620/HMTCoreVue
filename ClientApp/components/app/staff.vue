                                                    to clients of all ages, facing a variety of challenges and issues ranging
                                                    from depression, anxiety, low self-esteem/poor self-image, relationship
                                                    difficulties, to life transitions of all types. She has spent a considerable
                                                    portion of her career working in an acute psychiatric hospital helping

                                                            In her private clinical practice, she blends cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and other evidence-based practices with an
                                                            interpersonal process. She believes that the key to effective
                                                            treatment begins with the quality of the relationship and connection

                                                            in understanding what drives our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.
                                                            Ms. Kilgore uses her natural ability to empathize and offer unconditional
                                                            positive regard with an interactive and warm therapeutic style

                                                            ultimately, in realizing their own worth and abilities. She communicates
                                                            in an authentic and lively manner, and utilizes humor when appropriate.
                                                            She works alongside her clients to help them navigate life stressors
                                                            and challenges while making you feel comfortable and understood.
                                                            She challenges her clients appropriately by offering a different
                                                            perspective and new way of thinking. She is a guiding light.
