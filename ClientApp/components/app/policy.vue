                                                All remaining insurance companies are considered “out-of-network”. If your insurance company offers out-of-network benefits,
                                                you may receive reimbursement for the cost of sessions. Most insurance companies
                                                that provide out-of-network benefits cover between 50%-80% of the cost per
                                                session. Monthly statements for clients will be provided for submission to
                                                your insurance company so you may be reimbursed directly.

                                                Session spots are limited each week in efforts of devoting the appropriate amount of time and attention that is required
                                                to provide excellent service and outcomes. Therapy is most successful when
                                                sessions are regular and consistent. If you need to cancel an appointment,
                                                please contact me as soon as possible so we may reschedule. It is extremely
                                                difficult to schedule another client on short notice, which is why a full
                                                out-of-pocket fee for a missed appointment or an appointment cancelled in
                                                less than 24 hours will be assessed. If you know you will not be able to
                                                make your appointment the following week during your session, please let
                                                me know and I am happy to reschedule for you.
