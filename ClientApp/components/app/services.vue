                                Psychotherapy is talking to work through a problem. Healthy Minds Therapy thrives on evidence-based psychotherapy interventions
                                to promote the success of clients. We specialize in psychotherapy with individuals (children,
                                adolescents, adults) and couples with presenting issues - including those with depression,
                                anxiety, behavioral concerns and/or difficulties relating to challenging life events.
