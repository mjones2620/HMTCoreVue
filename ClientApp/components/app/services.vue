                            Psychotherapy is simply talking to work through problems! I thrive on the success of
                            evidence-based psychotherapy interventions to promote the success of clients.
                            Specializing in psychotherapy with individuals (children, adolescents, adults)
                            and couples with presenting issues including depression, anxiety, behavioral
                            concerns and difficulties relating to challenging life events.
                        <p>
                        <p>
                            As a Licensed Professional Counselor, I primarily use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
                            concepts as well as mindfulness and motivational interviewing interventions.
                            With sensitivity and compassion, I provide a safe, supportive and non-judgmental
                            environment specializing in suicidality and self-harming behaviors.
                            I also use trauma-informed therapy (TF-CBT) when appropriate with children,
                            adolescents and young adults. Are you ready to take the next step to a better life?
                            I look forward to working with you. Please call or email for an appointment.
