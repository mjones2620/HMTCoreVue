                                                    <p>A neuropsychological evaluation is an assessment of how the entire brain
                                                        is functioning. It examines a person’s attention, memory, language,
                                                        sensory system, emotions, mental control, academic skills, motor
                                                        skills and other areas. The goal of a neuropsychological assessment
                                                        is to “see" through many types of tests and games, how each part
                                                        of the brain is working and how they are working together. People
                                                        often request a neuropsychological evaluation when previous evaluations
                                                        have not quite answered their question or if the adult or child has
                                                        symptoms in more than one area. Common reasons for referral might
                                                        include a sports related concussion, brain injury, new problems with
                                                        memory, attention or motor skills, persistent learning problems,
                                                        slowed or uneven child development and many others. Neuropsychological
                                                        evaluations typically take a little longer than a typical psychological
                                                        evaluation. The results not only lead to accurate diagnoses but they
                                                        help illuminate a recommended treatment process or way forward. Neuropsychological
                                                        evaluations are a way to put the entire puzzle together when the
                                                        pieces don’t make sense.</p>

                                                        On the day of testing: please bring all relevant medical records, scans etc. These are important and can help the neuropsychologist
                                                        make decisions. Examples include EEG results, CAT scans, MRI’s or
                                                        blood work. For children, please come prepared to talk about their
                                                        birth and developmental history as well as their academic strengths
                                                        and weaknesses.
